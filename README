NAME
    MooseX::Types::Stringlike - Moose type constraints for strings or
    string-like objects

VERSION
    version 0.001

SYNOPSIS
      package Foo;
      use Moose;
      use MooseX::Types::Stringlike qw/Stringlike Stringable/;
  
      has path => ( 
        is => 'ro',
        isa => Stringlike,
        coerce => 1
      );

      has stringable_object => (
        is => 'ro',
        isa => Stringable,
      );

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides a more general version of the "Str" type. If
    coercions are enabled, it will accepts objects that overload
    stringification and coerces them into strings.

SUBTYPES
    This module uses MooseX::Types to define the following subtypes.

  Stringlike
    "Stringlike" is a subtype of "Str". It can coerce "Stringable" objects
    into a string.

  Stringable
    "Stringable" is a subtype of "Object" where the object has overloaded
    stringification.
